Rediscovering vim, I was doing my assignment which involve editing a SMV file, which is really rear supported by any editor, but vim has the ability to adopt a vim syntax file, so I can have syntax highlighting, and vim has all these great features, editing mode, pattern matching(auto completion in a way), and most importantly it is scripting, users can shape vim to their needs. It is the best editor, I will start to use vim for everything.

Update: Vim sees to be not so great when editing remote files(FTP, SFTP). Still using coda for those.
