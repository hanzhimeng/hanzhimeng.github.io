Wellington is an absolutely beautiful city, despite the wind, that is the perfect city I wanted to live in, lots of space, nice people, ten minutes drive to Petone beach(from where I was living, i.e. Lower Hutt)

Walking distance to shopping mall, Chinese restaurants(Good ones, i.e. first choice in Petone).

Walking distance to public transport, 15 mins to Naenae train station, 3 mins to bus stops.

With a bit more driving. Wellington Zoo, I think it is the best zoo in New Zealand

I loved the street fighters 3 thrid strike game, I came in third in one of the tornament. LOL, because <a title="Mintgames" target="_blank" href="http://mintgames.co.nz/">stupidlikeafox</a> was not in it. He taught me how to play the game.

To be continued.
