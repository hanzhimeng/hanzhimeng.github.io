I have been think about moving my blog to somewhere else other than the self-hosted [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org) site, it's a great blogging platform and site building tool, but it's been causing problems on my server, including me not know that the theme i used as a backdoor in it.

###This is hosted on Github, best service, and it's Free!

Yay.

I will blog more about tech stuff or my favourite sports here.
